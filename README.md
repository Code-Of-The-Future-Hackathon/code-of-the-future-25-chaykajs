## Overview

Solar weather events, such as solar flares, solar energetic particle (SEP) events, geomagnetic storms, and coronal hole high-speed streams (HSS), can have significant impacts on technology, from communication systems to satellite functionality. These events can cause disruptions to critical infrastructure, including power grids, GPS navigation, aviation systems, and satellite operations.

## Key Events

### 1. Solar Flares:
- **What:** Sudden bursts of electromagnetic radiation, including X-ray and ultraviolet light, from the Sun.
- **Why Alert:** Can cause radio blackouts, disrupt GPS and aviation communications, and damage satellites or power grids during extreme events.
- **Key Metrics:** 
  - Class: B, C, M, X (X-class is the strongest).
  - Peak X-ray flux (measured by GOES satellites).
- **Data Sources:**
  - NASA’s GOES X-ray Flux data.
  - Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) imagery.

### 2. Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) Events:
- **What:** High-energy protons ejected from solar flares or CME shocks.
- **Why Alert:** Risk to astronauts, aviation, and satellites. Can also cause "single-event upsets" in electronics.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - Proton flux levels (≥10 MeV).
  - NOAA’s Solar Radiation Storm Scale (S1-S5).
- **Data Sources:**
  - ACE satellite’s EPAM instrument.
  - NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).

### 3. Geomagnetic Storms:
- **What:** Disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere caused by CMEs, solar wind, or coronal hole streams.
- **Why Alert:** Can induce currents in power grids, disrupt satellite operations, and cause radio communication failures.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - Kp Index (0–9 scale).
  - Dst Index (storm severity).
- **Data Sources:**
  - DSCOVR satellite solar wind data.
  - Ground-based magnetometers (e.g., INTERMAGNET).

### 4. Coronal Hole High-Speed Streams (HSS):
- **What:** Fast solar wind streams originating from open magnetic field regions on the Sun.
- **Why Alert:** Cause recurrent geomagnetic storms, disrupt satellite drag, and affect orbital tracking.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - Solar wind speed (>500 km/s).
  - Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).
- **Data Sources:**
  - NASA’s Solar Wind Prediction Model.
  - ACE or DSCOVR real-time solar wind data.

### 5. Ionospheric Disturbances:
- **What:** Disruptions in Earth’s ionosphere caused by solar flares or particle events.
- **Why Alert:** Can degrade GPS accuracy, interfere with high-frequency radio signals, and affect aviation and emergency communications.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - Total Electron Content (TEC).
  - Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance (SID) monitors.
- **Data Sources:**
  - NASA’s Madrigal TEC database.
  - Global GNSS networks (e.g., IGS).

## How to Integrate Alerts into Your System

### 1. Multi-Event Dashboard:
Display real-time data for each event (X-ray flux for flares, Kp index for storms). Use color-coded severity levels to provide clear visual alerts.

### 2. Customizable Alerts:
Allow users to subscribe to specific alerts based on their role (e.g., pilots may care about SEPs, grid operators about geomagnetic storms).

### 3. Cross-Event Correlations:
Display potential cascading risks from different solar events (e.g., a strong X-class flare may trigger a CME or SEP event).

### 4. Impact Simulations:
Allows users to simulate how solar weather events could affect infrastructure or regions.

### 5. Educational Content:
Explains the science and potential real-world consequences of each event, helping users understand the risks.
